Ratings Archiver
================
This is a small application designed to scratch an itch to do some data visualization with ratings from 
beer review sites around the web. After importing them you can see trneds like ratings per month, ratings
by region, or geographical clustering of reviews.

All information is culled from [BreweryDB](http://wwww.brewerydb.com). To get started request an API key. Update the .env file to include your application key. This is private and should not be pushed back to the repository after being updated.
